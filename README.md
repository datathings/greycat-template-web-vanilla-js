# web-vanilla-js

## Install
Make sure you've updated the versions at the top of `project.gcl` and then:
```sh
greycat install
```

## Serve
In development, run the server with:
```sh
greycat serve --user=1
```

> This will directly serve GreyCat with the content of the `webroot/` directory available at `http://localhost:8080`


## Development
Have a look at:
- `project.gcl` (server entrypoint)
- `webroot/index.html` (web index entrypoint)
